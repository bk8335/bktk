<h1>BKTK Portfolio</h1>
<h1><%= @positions.count %></h1>
<h3>These are investments we have strong opinions on, and this is where we show our track record to the world.</h3>

<p>This blog only started the end of May 2018, so we're not going to buy/sell a million different things at once. These are not investment recommendations, and this does not represent our entire portfolio. Instead think of these as side holdings, accounting for a small percentage of the total, and it will be fun measuring how our decisions stack up against the overall market. Chances are we will be amongst the 90% who underperform</p>

<p>Here is a chronological order of assets we strongly like/dislike, the original post detailing why, and how the position has performed since.</p>
